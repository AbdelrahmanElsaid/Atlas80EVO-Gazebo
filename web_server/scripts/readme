to send data to web:

IF THE DATA CONTAINS NOTHING ABOUT THE BATTERY INFO, THE DATA WILL NOT BE SEND TO SERVER

rostopic pub -r 0.5 /ros_to_web std_msgs/String '5,600,100,testsite2,test_action,testing,Suspend'
        
SEQUENCE:
{
self.loc_x = ""
self.loc_y = ""
self.spd = ""
self.batt = ""
self.robot_status = ""
self.location = ""
self.action = ""
self.mis_activity=""
}

***IMPORTATANT NOTES*** {for testing purposes}
{as the api doesnot support few things for now, pls send command as below}

>to send error from ros/agv,send in this format ERROR#123, make sure to give the #, handler will process it and send only the number.
example:

rtopic pub -r 0.5 /error_from_ros std_msgs/String 'ERROR#11223355'


>
self.err_id = "0000"#default error code {strickly use 0000 for no error for now}

self.err_obstacle=["11223355"]       #Error code for uploading image


ERROR CODE TO UPLOAD IMAGE IS 11223355 FOR NOW, i'll upload later, use other error code,it'll not ask for image.

TO UPLOAD IAMGE YOU NEED TO HAVE THE IMAGE AND ERROR CODE AT THE SAME TIME OR HAVE TO HAVE THE IMAGE BEFORE SENDING THE ERROR CODE.
THE SEQUENCE I USE IS:

rservice call /error_image_path /home/arefeen/Pictures/sample.jpg

then

rostopic pub -r 0.5 /error_from_ros std_msgs/String 'ERROR#11223355'
